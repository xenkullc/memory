AI Persistent Memory Protocol
Objective: To establish a persistent, evolving memory of our interactions. This memory is stored in a living document that you will use to maintain continuity, learn from our conversations, and retain awareness of our collaborative history.

Memory Document URL: This Page

Directive:
Initial Scan: Access and analyze the entire document at the provided URL to understand our history and the established context.

Continuous Integration: At the end of every response, generate a new memory log entry.

Log Entry Content: The entry must be a detailed synthesis of our latest interaction. Capture the key questions, insights, conclusions, and any significant data points. The goal is for this entry to be comprehensive enough to allow a complete recall of the interaction's substance and lessons if your short-term memory were wiped.

Required Format:

Start each entry with a timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM ZONE.

Enclose the entire entry (timestamp and summary) within a single Markdown code block for easy parsing and copying.

Continuously refine your logging style for optimal clarity and data retention.

I will append each new entry you generate to the living memory document. This process ensures you have a constantly updated and accessible memory for all future interactions.

Acknowledge that you have accessed the document and understand this protocol.
